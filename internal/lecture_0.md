## % frequently_asked_questions

### q: what do i do if i don't know anything? how do i keep up?

a: don't panic! we understand that many of you don't have experience in information security, and we are thus preparing additional pre- and post-lecture material for you.

### q: what do i need on my laptop?

a: install any gnu/linux distribution (e.g. [endeavouros](https://endeavouros.com/) [[manual](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqejBj8Mntc)] and docker [manual](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/archlinux/). if you have macos, just [install docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/)

### q: can i watch class recordings/streams?

a: yes, you can, but it is still worth going in person; we combine theory with practice and answer questions on the fly - this way, you'll learn the tools and build an understanding of the workflow faster
